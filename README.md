**Problem Statement:** Data Analysis on an extensive dataset of crimes in Chicago (2005-2016) using Dask

**Libraries Used:** Mainly Dask, seaborn, matplotlib, folium

**Description:** This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2005-2016. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified.

**Findings:**

* Top 10 types of crimes are Theft, Battery, Criminal damage, Narcotics, Burglary, Other Offense, Assault, Motor Vehicle Theft , Robbery and Deceptive Practice
* The most common crime location is Chicago streets.
* We see the highest crimes reported in 2005.
* Austin is the highest crime community area in Chicago as per our analysis.
* Very few crime reports (~27.80%) end up in an arrest. But we found that in Narcotics related crimes, the arrest rate is very high almost 100%.
* Even if Theft is the most common crime in Chicago but Arrest rate is quite low comparatively.
* We can easily infer from the above graph that Fridays the criminal activities are at their highest. So, accordingly Police department can have more patrolling and preventive measures on Fridays to have a check on them.
* We can see clearly in the graph that the peak of the crimes is during summer(July) across all these years.
* Number of crimes reported has declined over the period of 10 year from 2006 to 2016.
